#### 31.	Usage of footpath, cycle path, and shared path. 
- Where footpath, cycle track or shared paths are provided, no pedestrian or cyclist shall, unless compelled by other circumstances, walk or cycle along and upon the portion of a road meant for vehicular traffic. Where footpath or shared path is not provided, the pedestrian shall, as far as practicable, after taking due precautions walk on the shoulder of the road and, if possible, in relation to their direction of travel facing traffic approaching from the opposite side.

####  32.	Cyclists on Shared paths. 
- On shared paths, cyclists will take due care while passing pedestrians. Cyclists must yield the right of way to pedestrians on a shared path and must give an audible signal like ringing of the cycle bell to alert the latter.


####  33.	Pedestrians' right of way at the intersections. 
- When traffic-control signals are not in place or not in operation, the driver of a vehicle shall yield the right of way, slowing down or stopping, if need be, to so yield to a pedestrian crossing the road within an intersection when the pedestrian is upon the half of the road upon which the vehicle is traveling, or when the pedestrian is approaching so closely from the opposite half of the road as to be in danger.


#### 34.	Pedestrians' right of way on footpaths. 
- The driver of a motor vehicle emerging from or entering a crossroad, building, private road or driveway shall yield the right of way to any pedestrian and /or cyclist approaching on any footpath, cycle track and / or shared paths extending across such crossroad, building entrance, road or driveway.


#### 35.	Crossing a Street. -

(1)	Ordinarily, pedestrians and cyclists must not cross a street except through the designated crossings, either at grade or grade separated. Where such crossings have not been provided, it is incumbent upon the Urban Local Body to designate and clearly mark the crossings as soon as feasible, in consultation with the Traffic Management Agency, so as to provide safe crossing facilities to pedestrians and cyclists.

(2)	Pedestrians shall obey the instructions of any traffic-control devices specifically applicable to them, unless otherwise directed by a police officer.

(3)	No pedestrian shall cross a road intersection diagonally unless authorized by official traffic-control devices; and, when authorized to
  
cross diagonally, pedestrians shall cross only in accordance with the official traffic-control devices pertaining to such crossing movements.

(4)	Every pedestrian, crossing a street at any point other than within a marked or unmarked crossing at an intersection or crossing a street where a safe crossing is yet to be provided, shall yield the right of way to vehicles upon the street.
