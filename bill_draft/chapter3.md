## CHAPTER III-Complete and connected urban streets with pedestrian and cycling network.
 
### 4.	Development of complete and connected streets. -
- It is the duty and responsibility of every Urban Local Body to design, construct and maintain a network of complete and connected streets, with footpaths of adequate width, and segregated cycle tracks or shared paths as permitted by the right of way of the street, for the use of pedestrians and cyclists, within their jurisdiction.


### 5.	People-centric design of urban streets. 
- Urban streets shall be designed to prioritise mobility of people of all ages and abilities over mobility of vehicles. The width of lanes for movement of private vehicles shall be fixed after provision of footpaths, cycle tracks or shared paths of adequate width for the movement of people by walk or by cycles and by public transport, where it is available.
 
 

### 6.	Identification and completion of missing links. -**

- (1)	Missing links or lack of direct connectivity due to existing properties, if any, in the pedestrian and cycling network shall be identified by the Urban Local Bodies and informed to the concerned Local Planning Authorities. The latter shall ensure that land of required width is compulsorily demarcated and transferred at no cost to the former as and when the properties come for redevelopment.

- (2)	Walking and cycling paths shall be created and maintained through parks and along lake bunds and shall be accessible for movement of pedestrians and cyclists during the operational hours, to provide short and direct connectivity.
