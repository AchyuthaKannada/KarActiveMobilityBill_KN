## CHAPTER V - Elements of complete and connected streets.

####  11.	Development of Footpaths. -

(1)	Footpaths shall be designed and constructed on all urban streets to form a network that is:

(a)	continuous, connected, free from obstructions, and provides short and direct routes for walking within the neighbourhood;

(b)	accessible and convenient to use for all users, especially children, elderly, and persons with disabilities;

(c)	well- drained, well-lit;

(d)	well-connected to the public transit stations and bus stops to provide first and last mile connectivity; and

(e)	safe to use through implementation of measures like kerb ramps at crossings, pedestrian refuges, pedestrian signal phases, and traffic calming measures.

Provided where vending zones are identified and duly notified by the Urban Local Bodies, such zones shall be demarcated, developed and maintained to

ensure no obstruction whatsoever to the unimpeded and safe movement of pedestrians.
 


####   12.	Development of cycle tracks. -

(1)	Urban Local Bodies shall provide dedicated cycle tracks with safe segregation from the main carriageway for the use of cyclists, to the extent possible. Cycle tracks shall be:

(a)	continuous and connected to form a complete cycling network;

(b)	designed, if feasible, to allow for contraflow movements on one-way streets;

(c)	of reasonable width to facilitate safe movement of cyclists either one way or two-way as the case may be;

(d)	well-lit with adequate drainage facilities; and

(e)	accessible from cycle stands, public bike sharing hubs, bus stops and public transit stations.

Provided where the existing road widths do not permit provision of segregated cycle tracks, shared paths shall be developed for use of both pedestrians and
cyclists, with surface treatment conducive for both walking and cycling.



####   13.	Safe crossings at intersections and street mid-blocks. -

(1)	Pedestrians and cyclists shall be able to safely cross the streets, preferably at-grade. The pedestrian and bicycle crossings shall be clearly demarcated and well-lit. Where the intersections are signalised, adequate duration shall be allocated to pedestrians and cyclists to enable people of all ages and abilities to safely cross the street.

(2)	Pedestrian over-bridges and pedestrian underpasses may be planned and provided at intersections and mid-blocks, on streets with carriageway consisting of more than four lanes if provision of safe at-grade crossing is not feasible for valid reasons.

(3)	The footprint of the grade-separated crossings shall be located such that pedestrian movements are not impeded on footpaths. Pedestrian over-bridges and underpasses shall be well lit and shall be made universally accessible either through provisions of gentle ramps, escalators or elevators.
